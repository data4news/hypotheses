# Hypotheses

In-class assignment.

- See `notebook-1.ipynb` through `notebook-4.ipynb` contain the assignments. 
    - The notebooks get increasingly abstract. 
    - `notebook-1.ipynb` uses mtcars. You don't really have to make any methodological choices. You just practice creating null and alternate hypotheses, plotting data, running t-tests and interpreting them. 
    - `notebook-2.ipynb` uses the census data. This time it's real data, but most of the methodological choices are made for you. Just zoom down to step 7 and follow the instructions to practice more t-tests with real data.
    - `notebook-3.ipynb` uses the polly data. You have to make some methodological choices.
    - `notebook-4.ipynb` uses the FiveThirtyEight's pollster ratings. You have to make a lot of methodological choices and may come to different conclusions based on the choices you make.
